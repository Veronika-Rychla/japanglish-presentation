        <h2>What is a visual novel?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>According to Wikipedia</strong>, a visual novel is a form of digital
          semi-interactive fiction. It combines elements of classical
          storytelling with animated illustrations, music background, dialogues
          either dubbed by professional voice actors or silent and…
          interactivity! The level of interactivity varies. While some games
          have very complicated decision-making designs and even one wrong
          answer might mean not getting the outcome you want, there are also
          many visual novels that will let you chill.

          <strong>Have you ever wanted to become a protagonist of a book you're reading?</strong>
          Talk to characters yourself? Decide how to answer them? Well, add some
          lovely pictures and that's basically what a visual novel is all about.
          Of course, there are many amazing games that have been doing it for
          years ever since role-playing games started back in 1980s. However,
          the main difference is that a visual novel is much closer to reading a
          normal novel because it relies only on dialogues to convey its story.

          Since <strong>visual novels originated in Japan where they are hugely popular</strong>,
          it's no wonder that their art style in most cases resembles an anime.
          It's a pity that outside Japan, visual novels remain marginalised and
          mostly ignored by gamers. The reason why Western gamers treat Japanese
          visual novels as “some weird stuff from Asia” and often confuse them
          with hentai <em>(anime and manga porn)</em> is because, admittedly, a lot of
          visual novels feature erotica so people tend to omit all those amazing
          visual novels which don't.

          <strong>Why do people enjoy visual novels when there're games much more
          sophisticated?</strong> Maybe it's the art style, maybe it's the absence of
          fighting which makes visual games more relaxing and casual. Maybe it's
          that feeling that you have to consciously develop your relationships
          with characters in order to win them over. Whatever the reason, visual
          novels are a hybrid medium and as such, they can be enjoyed by both
          bookworms and gamers. Try one as well! Maybe ours?
